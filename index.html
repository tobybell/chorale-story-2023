<h2>June 19&#8211;July 2</h2>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>It was an odd day. Everything was backwards, with people driving on the wrong side of the road. Chorale members were all ready to drop from tiredness, only the lure of seeing sheep and maybe getting to eat Indian food propping them up.

<p>From the bus, Maya called out, "look at the kites!"

<p>Alas, without bird-watching eyes, for many of us they stayed out of sight.

<p>But then, something emerged from the road: a platypus.

<p>Not just any platypus. Perry the platypus. Not that that was noticed. But alas it was okay. Instead an uproar occurred.

<p>Toby looked into the crowds of the people of the bus and states, "Who do I know the least?" before choosing Sarah. Akshar responds with, "More like who you hate the most." All in jest—at least I hope.

<p>Anyways the story continues. Perry the platypus reappeared. Offended by the lack of attention he got he screams. Screams that kinda sound like the Dove—an organ crash—but like choir rock music. Compelled by this Akshar of course has to join in—can't leave Perry on his own.

<p>Ben then bellows, "No not enough people on a part singing!" Perry stops. We all stop and stare. Then a unicorn jumps out of the bus. Do I know why? No. I don't. It gives the Chorale members an epic quest—a hero's journey type of quest if you will.

<p>The unicorn encourages the members to save the king. How do they do so? Through seeing the future by Jin-Hee. Jin-Hee uses her special singing powers to make a crystal glass shatter, and the shards reveal a map to the places that the Chorale must go. To help the unicorn sends with the members Perry the platypus—ha I bet you thought you saw the end of him, will no. Probably he will leave after this chapter though. Anyways the shards create a rather pointy map. So Cece takes a picture. Or at least tries to.

<p>Instead the shards disappear into the ether. Welp, so much for that quest Millie states. Instead the quest becomes replaced with a cheese quest because Chorale likes cheese. So they tour around town looking for cheeses—like little mice. Singing mice that is. Because this is Chorale and not a rowing team, they sing as they search. People whip their heads around to stare. Stare I hope in awe. Probably but who can really know.

<p>As such by the rolling fields the jolly group continues on a journey—each person searching for their own personal goals and answers in the ever-continuing void and journey that is life. But I digress, on this motion sickness-inducing bus journey the Chorale members maybe unite. Who knows what happens as the Odyssey towards Narnia via Turkish delights had begun.
