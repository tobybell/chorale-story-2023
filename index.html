<h2>June 19&#8211;July 2</h2>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>It was an odd day. Everything was backwards, with people driving on the wrong side of the road. Chorale members were all ready to drop from tiredness, only the lure of seeing sheep and maybe getting to eat Indian food propping them up.

<p>From the bus, Maya called out, "look at the kites!"

<p>Alas, without bird-watching eyes, for many of us they stayed out of sight.

<p>But then, something emerged from the road: a platypus.

<p>Not just any platypus. Perry the platypus. Not that that was noticed. But alas it was okay. Instead an uproar occurred.

<p>Toby looked into the crowds of the people of the bus and states, "Who do I know the least?" before choosing Sarah. Akshar responds with, "More like who you hate the most." All in jest—at least I hope.

<p>Anyways the story continues. Perry the platypus reappeared. Offended by the lack of attention he got he screams. Screams that kinda sound like the Dove—an organ crash—but like choir rock music. Compelled by this Akshar of course has to join in—can't leave Perry on his own.

<p>Ben then bellows, "No not enough people on a part singing!" Perry stops. We all stop and stare. Then a unicorn jumps out of the bus. Do I know why? No. I don't. It gives the Chorale members an epic quest—a hero's journey type of quest if you will.

<p>The unicorn encourages the members to save the king. How do they do so? Through seeing the future by Jin-Hee. Jin-Hee uses her special singing powers to make a crystal glass shatter, and the shards reveal a map to the places that the Chorale must go. To help the unicorn sends with the members Perry the platypus—ha I bet you thought you saw the end of him, will no. Probably he will leave after this chapter though. Anyways the shards create a rather pointy map. So Cece takes a picture. Or at least tries to.

<p>Instead the shards disappear into the ether. Welp, so much for that quest Millie states. Instead the quest becomes replaced with a cheese quest because Chorale likes cheese. So they tour around town looking for cheeses—like little mice. Singing mice that is. Because this is Chorale and not a rowing team, they sing as they search. People whip their heads around to stare. Stare I hope in awe. Probably but who can really know.

<p>As such by the rolling fields the jolly group continues on a journey—each person searching for their own personal goals and answers in the ever-continuing void and journey that is life. But I digress, on this motion sickness-inducing bus journey the Chorale members maybe unite. Who knows what happens as the Odyssey towards Narnia via Turkish delights had begun.

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>The magic of the Turkish Delights did more than merely sput their journey, however. As they sped along their journey, the adventurers began to change, transform, and combine in mysterious ways, until by the time they reached their first obstacle, the group consisted of Trip, Julia, and Charlie. They realised they would likely continue to mysteriously transform over the course of their odyssey, and resolved to discuss it no further.

<p>Standing in their paith was an acrid-smelling lake that bubbled and churned with malevolence, stretching as far as the eye could see in both directions.

<p>"This is the legendary acid lake known as <i>Lagunita</i>!" said Trip. "We must have made it to Wampus."

<p>The only way across the fetid pool appeared to be a rickety old bridge that spanned the lake. They party made their way towards it, when suddenly a ghostly figured shambled out in front of them, blocking access to the bridge. His hunched stature, shallow skin, and unkempt, greasy hair betrayed his identity as a bridge troll, or perhaps a CS major.

<p>In a sharp, nasally tone, he chanted at the adventurers, "The bridge-troll Diego be my name / to pass this way, you must play my game. / If Narnia you wish to see / then answer me these riddles three!"

<p>The party glanced nervously at one another.

<p>"Doesn't look like we have a choice," said Charlie. "Let's play."

<p>Bridge-troll Diego gave a wolfish, haunting grin as he began: "Come to a cave, that's where she'll be / this bridegroom's wife, strange mystery!"

<p>Trip's eyes lit up with recognition. "I know this one! It's the Virgin Mary, from 'Today the Virgin!'"

<p>Scowling, the bridge-troll nodded and gestured for Trip to cross. As Trip began picking his way across the battered old bridge, the sneering troll prepared to ask his second devious riddle of the remaining two adventurers.

<p>"Before across this brige you can go, / let's see how many composers you know. / If passage you wish to get from me, / name ten composers who start with B!"

<p>"You'd better let me take this one, since you were studying abroad last quarter," declared Julia to Charlie. "Let's see... there's Byrd, Britten, Bruckner, Brahms, Bairstow, Bárdos, Biebl, Barber, Buchenberg, and..." she trailed off, struggling to think of a 10th.
